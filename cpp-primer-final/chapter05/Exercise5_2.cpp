//Exercise 5.2: What is a block? When might you use a block?
/*
a block is surrounded by a pair of curly braces { ... }. Also called a compound statement, it is either a sequence of
statements and declarations or left empty. Used when the program requires additional logic after for example a for loop or
while loop etc.
