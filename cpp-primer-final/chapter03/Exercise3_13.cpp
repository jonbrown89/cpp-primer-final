//Exercise 3.13: How many elements are there in each of the following vectors? What are the values of the elements?
/*
        (a) vector<int> v1;
        (b) vector<int> v2(10);
        (c) vector<int> v3(10, 42);
        (d) vector<int> v4{10};
        (e) vector<int> v5{10, 42);
        (f) vector<string> v6{10};
        (g) vector<string> v7{10, "hi"};



        (a) v1 = empty vector of int type
        (b) v2 = vector of int type that holds 10 empty elements
        (c) v3 = vector of int type that holds 10 elements of value 42
        (d) v4 = vector of int type that holds 1 element of value 10
        (e) v5 = vector of int type that holds 2 elements of value 10 and 42
        (f) v6 = vector of string type that holds 10 empty string elements
        (g) v7 = vector of string type that holds 10 elements of string literal "hi"
