//Exercise 3.34: Given that p1 and p2 point to elements in the same array, what does the following code do? Are there values
// of p1 or p2 that make this code illegal?
//          p1 += p2 - p1;


// p1 += p2 - p1 is equivalent to writing p1 = p2
// if the values of p1 and p2 are valid then the code is legal
// there are no values of p1 or p2 that would make this code illegal given the constraint of "p1 and p2 point to elements
// in the same array"
