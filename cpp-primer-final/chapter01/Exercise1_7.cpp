//Exercise 1.7: Compile a program that has incorrectly nested comments.

///*
// * comment pairs /*     */ cannot nest.
// * "cannot nest" is considered source code,
//* as is the rest of the program
// */

// /*
// *everything inside a single-line comment is ignored
// *including nested comment pairs
// */
