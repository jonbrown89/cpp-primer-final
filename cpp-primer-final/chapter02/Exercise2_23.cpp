//Exercise 2.23: Given a pointer p, can you determine whether p points to a valid object? If so, how? If
// not, why not?


// no, pointer validity is the programmer's responsibility. The language provides no built-in mechanism to verify whether
// a non-null pointer points to a valid, accessible object.
